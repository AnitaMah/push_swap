# push_swap

## Description

`push_swap` sorts a stack of integers using only two stacks (`a` and `b`) and a restricted set of operations. The goal is to produce the shortest possible sequence of operations that leaves all integers sorted in ascending order on stack `a`.

The project explores algorithmic complexity hands-on: different input sizes and disorder levels call for fundamentally different strategies to stay within the operation limits.

**Allowed operations:**

| Operation | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| `sa` / `sb` | Swap the top two elements of stack a / b |
| `ss` | `sa` and `sb` simultaneously |
| `pa` / `pb` | Push top of b → a / top of a → b |
| `ra` / `rb` | Rotate stack a / b upward (top becomes bottom) |
| `rr` | `ra` and `rb` simultaneously |
| `rra` / `rrb` | Reverse rotate a / b (bottom becomes top) |
| `rrr` | `rra` and `rrb` simultaneously |

## Instructions

### Compilation

```bash
make        # builds push_swap
make clean  # removes object files
make fclean # removes objects + binary
make re     # full rebuild
```

### Usage

```bash
./push_swap [--simple | --medium | --complex | --adaptive] [--bench] <integers...>
```

| Flag | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| *(none)* | Adaptive mode (default) |
| `--simple` | Forces O(n²) selection sort |
| `--medium` | Forces O(n√n) chunk sort |
| `--complex` | Forces O(n log n) radix sort |
| `--adaptive` | Picks algorithm by measured disorder |
| `--bench` | Prints disorder %, strategy, and op count to stderr after sorting |

### Examples

```bash
# Basic sort
./push_swap 2 1 3 6 5 8

# Force a specific algorithm
./push_swap --simple 5 4 3 2 1
./push_swap --complex 4 67 3 87 23

# Verify output with checker
ARG="4 67 3 87 23"
./push_swap --complex $ARG | ./checker_linux $ARG

# Count operations (adaptive, 5 numbers)
ARG="4 67 3 87 23"
./push_swap --adaptive $ARG | wc -l

# Benchmark 500 numbers
shuf -i 0-9999 -n 500 > args.txt
./push_swap $(cat args.txt) | wc -l

# Benchmark mode with metrics
./push_swap --bench --adaptive 4 67 3 87 23 2>bench.txt
cat bench.txt
```

### Error handling

The program prints `Error` to stderr and exits on:
- Non-integer arguments (e.g. `"abc"`, `"one"`)
- Values outside INT range
- Duplicate values
- Empty string arguments

## Algorithms

### Disorder metric

Before sorting, we measure how disordered the input is using an **inversion count**:

```
disorder = inversions / total_pairs
```

Where an inversion is any pair (i, j) with i < j but arr[i] > arr[j]. A sorted array has disorder 0.0; a fully reversed array has disorder 1.0. This is computed on the original integer array before any stack moves.

---

### 1. Simple — Selection Sort Adaptation — O(n²)

**Used when:** `--simple` flag, or adaptive mode with very low disorder (< 0.15 for n ≤ 100, < 0.10 for n > 100).

**How it works:**

1. Repeatedly scan stack `a` for the minimum value (`find_min_node`).
2. Use `bring_to_top` to rotate the minimum to the top of `a` (choosing `ra` or `rra` based on whichever is shorter).
3. Push it to `b` with `pb`.
4. Once `a` is empty, restore from `b` to `a` by always pulling the maximum from `b` — this lands them in ascending order in `a`.

**Why O(n²):** Finding the minimum requires scanning all remaining elements — done n times = n² comparisons total.

**Justification:** Works well when the input is nearly sorted (low disorder), since `bring_to_top` needs very few rotations when the minimum is already near the top.

---

### 2. Medium — Chunk Sort — O(n√n)

**Used when:** `--medium` flag, or adaptive mode with medium disorder (≥ 0.15 for n ≤ 100, ≥ 0.10 for n > 100, but below radix threshold).

**How it works:**

1. **Normalize** all values to indices 0..n-1 (rank order), so we can reason about position rather than raw value.
2. **Divide** into chunks of size √n (15 for n ≤ 100, 30 for larger inputs).
3. **Push chunks to b:** Scan `a` for elements whose index falls in the current chunk range. Push them to `b`, and if an element's index is in the lower half of the chunk, send it to the bottom of `b` with `rb` — so higher-indexed elements accumulate at the top of `b`.
4. **Restore to a:** Pull elements from `b` largest-index-first (using `bring_to_top` on the max each time) with `pa`. Since we push max first, `a` ends up in ascending order.

**Why O(n√n):** There are √n chunks. Processing each chunk costs O(n) rotations to scan `a`. Restoring each chunk costs O(√n) rotations per element to bring max to top. Total ≈ n√n operations.

**Justification:** The chunk strategy dramatically reduces wasted rotations compared to selection sort for moderately disordered inputs, without requiring the bit-manipulation of radix sort.

---

### 3. Complex — Radix Sort (LSD bitwise) — O(n log n)

**Used when:** `--complex` flag, or adaptive mode with high disorder on large inputs.

**How it works:**

1. **Normalize** values to indices 0..n-1.
2. For each bit from LSB to MSB (log₂(n) passes total):
   - Scan all elements in `a`. If the current bit of an element's index is **0** → push to `b`. If **1** → rotate to bottom of `a` with `ra`.
   - After processing all elements, push everything from `b` back to `a` with `pa`.
3. After all bits are processed, indices are sorted in ascending order = sorted.

**Why O(n log n):** There are log₂(n) bit passes, each touching all n elements = n log n operations.

**Justification:** Radix sort is the most scalable option. For 500 elements it achieves roughly 5000–7000 operations, comfortably under the 12000 requirement and often under 8000 for good performance.

### 4. Adaptive — Disorder-Driven Selection

**Used when:** `--adaptive` flag or no flag given (default).

The adaptive strategy measures disorder first, then selects the most appropriate algorithm:

| Input size | Disorder | Strategy chosen | Complexity |
|------------|----------|-----------------|------------|
| ≤ 5 | any | Hardcoded optimal | O(1) |
| ≤ 100 | < 0.15 | Selection sort | O(n²) |
| ≤ 100 | ≥ 0.15 | Chunk sort | O(n√n) |
| > 100 | < 0.10 | Selection sort | O(n²) |
| > 100 | ≥ 0.10 | Radix sort | O(n log n) |

**Rationale for thresholds:**
- At very low disorder, the minimum element is usually already near the top, so selection sort's O(n²) scans cost very few rotations in practice.
- At medium disorder, chunk sort's O(n√n) beats radix sort for small n because radix has higher constant overhead (log₂(n) full passes regardless of order).
- At high disorder with large n, radix sort's consistent O(n log n) always wins.

---

### Helper: `bring_to_top`

Used by both selection sort and chunk sort. Given a target node, it counts how many `ra` operations vs `rra` operations it would take to bring that node to the top, and picks the shorter path. This is what keeps both algorithms from being wasteful with rotations.

## Performance

| Input | Requirement | Good | Excellent |
|-------|------------|------|-----------|
| 100 random | < 2000 ops | < 1500 ops | < 700 ops |
| 500 random | < 12000 ops | < 8000 ops | < 5500 ops |

Typical results with this implementation:
- 100 numbers: ~700–900 ops (chunk sort path)
- 500 numbers: ~6000–7000 ops (radix sort path)

## AI Usage

Artificial Intelligence tools were used as supplementary learning and documentation resources during the development of this project.

Their use was limited to:
- Discussing algorithmic approaches and complexity analysis
- Reviewing documentation for clarity and readability
- Identifying potential edge cases in parsing and input validation
- Providing general feedback on code structure and project organization
- Assisting in the creation of an initial README structure based on the project's source code and features

No AI-generated code was copied into the final project. All implementation decisions, coding, testing, debugging, and validation were carried out by the contributors. AI was not used to write or generate any C source code included in this repository. All implementations are the original work of the authors.

Any suggestions obtained through AI tools were critically reviewed, understood, and adapted before being considered for inclusion.
